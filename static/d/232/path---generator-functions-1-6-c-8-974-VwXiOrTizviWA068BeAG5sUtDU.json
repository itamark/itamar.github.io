How exciting!\n\nI'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.\n\nOh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on\n[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).\n\n> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck\n> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian\n> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\n> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\n> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\n> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\n> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.\n\n![Chinese Salty Egg](./salty_egg.jpg) -->","frontmatter":{"title":"Generator Functions","date":"May 01, 2015","hidden":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/generator-functions.1/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/generator-functions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Generator Functions"}}}}
