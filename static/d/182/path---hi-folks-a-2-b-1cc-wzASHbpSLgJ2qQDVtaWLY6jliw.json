This gave me serious anxiety.\nWhat topic could I possibly suggest? </p>\n<p>I decided to break down the factors to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should somehow be new or interesting to these top-of-their-game frontend developers.</li>\n<li>It should be long enough that there would be enough content to delve deeper into.</li>\n<li>It should be short enough that it can be explained in full with enough time for questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I began researching topics - and thought the best route might be to go with a newer part of Javascript - ES6.
