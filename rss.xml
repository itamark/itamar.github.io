&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Recently, I had the opportunity to interview at one of the bigger companies - the kind with software engineers at the top of their field.

As part of the full-day, 5-interview &apos;loop&apos; they put me through - I was asked to present on any topic of my choosing. This gave me serious anxiety.
What topic could I possibly suggest? 

I decided to break down the factors to consider:  
* It should somehow be new or interesting to these top-of-the-field frontend developers.
* It should be long enough that there would be enough content to delve deeper into.
* It should be short enough that it can be explained in full with enough time for questions.

I began researching topics - and thought the best route might be to go with a newer part of Javascript - ES6. More specifically, I wanted to find a feature that is 
powerful, has many use cases, but simple and straightforward.  
Then I found the Symbol.

## Why I chose Symbol

Symbol ticked all of the above boxes.  
The concept is simple - it&apos;s a JS primitive, after all. --&gt;

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

&gt; Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
&gt; Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
&gt; right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

&gt; The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
&gt; been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
&gt; would be the word &quot;and&quot; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
&gt; return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word &quot;and&quot; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it

Oh, and here&apos;s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

&gt; A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
&gt; eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
&gt; supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
&gt; charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
&gt; wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
&gt; salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
&gt; firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
